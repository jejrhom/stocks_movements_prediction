# Stocks mouvements 

Will a stock go down or up in the next 15 days? This is what I tried to answer by working on a classification model, a Random Forest had a pretty good results. Other models could be tested.

The model is retrained everytime depending on the selected company.

I am also scrapping the latest news about the company to enrich the information that we have and then make better investments decisions.
